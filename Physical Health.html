          What Is Physical Health?
          <br/></b>
        > Physical health refers to the overall condition of the body and its ability to perform daily tasks efficiently and effectively.
        It encompasses a variety of factors, including but not limited to, body composition, muscular strength, cardiovascular endurance, flexibility, and overall physical functioning.
        Good physical health means that an individual is free from illness, injury, 
        or any other physical limitations that may hinder their ability to carry out daily activities.

        <b>> There are many reasons why we get sick. Some of the most common causes of illness include:</b><br>
        <br>1. Infectious agents: Bacteria, viruses, parasites and fungi, as known as pathogens, 
        can all cause infections that lead to illness.</br></br>
        
        2. Environmental factors: Exposure to pollutants, toxins, and other environmental hazards
        can increase the risk of developing certain diseases.</br>
        
        <br>3. Genetics: Inherited genetic mutations can increase the risk of developing certain diseases.</br></br>
        
        4. Lifestyle factors: Unhealthy lifestyle choices such as poor diet, lack of exercise, and substance abuse can increase the risk of developing chronic diseases.</br></br>
        
        5. Stress: Chronic stress can weaken the immune system and make the body more vulnerable to illness.<br></br>
        
        It's important to note that each person's individual health is influenced by a complex interplay of factors,
        and the reasons for illness can vary widely from person to person. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle, getting regular check-ups,
        and seeking prompt medical attention when needed can all help reduce the risk of getting sick.</br>

      <b> > Disease can be classified into two, namely infectious diseases and non-infectious diseases.</b> 
      </br>  </br>  
        *Infectious diseases are caused by infection of pathogens directly such as bacteria, viruses, fungi,
        or parasites that can be transmitted from person to person or through contact with contaminated objects or surfaces. <br>
        -Examples of infectious diseases include the flu, HIV/AIDS, measles, tuberculosis, and COVID-19.<br>
        <br>
        *Non-infectious diseases, on the other hand, are not caused by pathogens and cannot be transmitted from person to person. 
        Instead, they are often caused by a combination of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors.<br>
        -Examples of non-infectious diseases include heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and autoimmune disorders.</br>
        <br>
        It is important to note that while infectious and non-infectious diseases have different causes,
        they can have similar symptoms and can both have a significant impact on overall health and well-being.</br></br>

            > Diseases can spread in a variety of ways, depending on the specific disease.
                Here are some common ways that diseases can spread:<br>
                <br>1. Airborne transmission: Some diseases can spread through tiny droplets in the air, such as when someone coughs, sneezes, talks and even yawns.
                While some diseases can be transferred in form of dust.
                Dust transmission is caused by the drying of saliva which contain Pathogens and turn into dust. </br>
                -Examples include the flu, tuberculosis, SARS, and COVID-19.</br>
                <br>
                2. Waterborne transmission: Waterborne diseases are illnesses that are caused by consuming or coming into contact with contaminated water.
                 These diseases can be caused by a variety of pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, and parasites.</br>
                -Example include Cholera, Giardiasis, Cryptosporidiosis, Hepatitis A and Typhoid fever.</br>
                <br>
                3. Direct contact: Diseases can also spread through direct contact with an infected person's bodily fluids, such as blood, saliva, or semen. </br>
                -Examples include HIV, hepatitis B and C, and Ebola.</br>
                <br>
                4. Indirect contact: Diseases can also spread through indirect contact with contaminated objects or surfaces, such as doorknobs, phones, or utensils. </br>
                -Examples include the common cold, norovirus, and MRSA.</br>
                <br>
                5. Vector-borne transmission: Some diseases are spread by insects or other animals, such as cockroach, fly, rat and Aedes mosquito, that act as carriers, or vectors.
                <br>-Examples include malaria, Lyme disease, Dengue virus, and Zika virus.</br>
                <br>
                6. Foodborne transmission: Diseases can also spread through contaminated food or water.</br>
                -Examples include salmonella, E. coli, and cholera.</br>
                <br>
                7. Sexual transmission: Some diseases are spread through sexual contact.</br> 
                -Examples include chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis.</br>
                <br>It's important to note that each disease has its own unique method of transmission, and some diseases can be spread in multiple ways.
                 Understanding how diseases are spread can help individuals take steps to reduce their risk of infection and help prevent the spread of disease to others.</br>

            <b>> There are various kinds of pathogens. Luckily, there are several ways to prevent getting diseases: </b></br>
            <br>1. Wash your hands regularly: Hand washing is one of the most effective ways to prevent the spread of disease. 
            Wash your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, 
            especially before eating, after using the bathroom, and after being in public places.</br>
        </br>
            2. Get vaccinated: Vaccines are a safe and effective way to protect against many diseases. 
            Check with your healthcare provider to make sure you are up to date on recommended vaccinations.</br>
        </br>
            3. Practice good hygiene: Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleeve when coughing or sneezing, 
            avoid touching your face, and avoid close contact with people who are sick.</br>
        </br>
            4. Stay home when sick: If you are feeling sick, stay home to avoid spreading germs to others.</br>
        </br>
            5. Eat a healthy diet: Eating a well-balanced diet that includes plenty of fruits and vegetables can help boost your immune system and
             protect against disease.</br>
            </br>
            6. Exercise regularly: Regular physical activity can help strengthen your immune system and reduce your risk of developing chronic diseases.</br>
        </br>
            7. Practice safe sex: Use condoms and get tested regularly for sexually transmitted infections to protect yourself and your partners.</br>
        </br>
            8. Drink clean water: Make sure you drink clean, safe water. This can be achieved by using a water filtration system or boiling water before drinking it.
             You can also use bottled water if it's available and trustworthy.</br>
            </br>
            9. Avoid swimming in contaminated water: Avoid swimming or playing in lakes, rivers, or oceans that may be contaminated with sewage or other pollutants.</br>
        </br>
            10. Proper sanitation: Proper sanitation can help prevent the spread of waterborne diseases. This includes using proper waste disposal methods and
             ensuring that sewage is treated before it is released into the environment.</br>
            
            <br>By following these prevention measures, you can reduce your risk of getting sick and help prevent the spread of disease to others.</br>
